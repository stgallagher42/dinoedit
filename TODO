Dinoedit thoughts

# Naming. I'm thinking "ConTEXT"? Caps?
Dino is cute, but sounds cheesy..


# Context menus
 Need them. We have none. Copy and paste would be nice. So would undo and redo.
 One on the file list too - save, close, rename, rename file..

# Supertools
I like the little name for this one.. Anyway, we should include some tools that help the average user. I'm thinking maybe something like:

Merge and Split
	by line, character, block, regex..
	maybe by "model" - some predefined text that would repeat and define merge and split?

Regexes - find and replace
	Hopefully the user could do a lot of text without much intervention
	maybe cool features like each x-many lines or bytes? A specific place in a block or something like that?

Bookmarks
	These need to be able to move across blocks. We may or may not need to save these. This is probably a minor issue.

Syntax Highlighting
	This could be intricate, but maybe we shouldn't assume code. Probably something more flexible, like a certain column or row?
	Datatype assertion would be nice. Highlight what isn't a digit, for example.
